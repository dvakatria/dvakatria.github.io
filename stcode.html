<h3>Main Page - About Me</h3>
<p><strong>Hey!</strong> I&#39;ve been coding for about a year, more about skills <a href="sklpage.html">here</a>. Most often I program in <strong>HTML/CSS</strong> and <strong>bash (shell)</strong>. I work on various projects, one of them is Ubuntu for Coders, more details <a href="prjpage.html">here</a>. This is one of my first HTML/CSS projects.</p>
